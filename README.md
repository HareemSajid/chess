# Chess Game (C++ & SFML)

A basic chess game built in **C++** using **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

* Provides an 8Ã—8 chessboard with alternating light and dark squares.
* Full initial setup of pieces for both players.
* Mouse-driven piece selection and movement.
* Turn-based play: White and Black alternate turns.
* Basic move validation for: Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King.
* King capture detection ends the game and announces the winner.
* Start (cover) screen and end screen.
* Demonstrates OOP: inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation, and association.
