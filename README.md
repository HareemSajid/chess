-> Chess Game in C++ with SFML

This project is a basic chess game built using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).  
It features a functional chessboard with piece textures, player turns, piece selection via mouse clicks, and basic move validation.

- Turn-based play: white and black alternate turns  
- Basic move validation for all pieces (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)  
- King capture detection to end the game  
- Checkmate logic
- Cover page (start screen)  
- Use of inheritance and polymorphism (Pieces class inherits from Chess, with virtual methods)
